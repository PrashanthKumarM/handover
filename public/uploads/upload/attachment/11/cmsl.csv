Alastair Cook,36,5000,Microsoft Office 2016,3,"The change of the licensing[ if your computer dies (dropped, spilled water on it, just expires) and you have to get a replacement] forces me to buy Office all over again. Even if I got an accident/damage protection plan on my laptop/notebook, I still have to fork out $400 for the privilege of reinstalling the software  I already bought. Outrageous!",2
Stuart Broad,24,2000,Microsoft Outlook,4,"Everything you know and love about the Office interface is practically gone. Outlook has the most changes - making darn near unusable. Outlook has long been my favorite. Work finally switched from Lotus Notes to Outlook a year back - I was thrilled. The look of this was so shocking that after a day I uninstalled it, and went back to my 2010 (of course MS won't refund my money either)",2
Joe Root,15,10000,Windows Vista,2,"This release reminds me of the ""stay away from every other version of Windows"" rule. Vista, disaster",2
Ericson,9,46700,Microsoft Exchange Server,1,"Some employees in our company have a problem in connecting to their on-premise Exchange environment due to brand-new installation of Exchange, and there were connectivity problems through Outlook Web App involving certificates, as well as ActiveSync issues.Kindly help to resolve the issue as ASAP.",2
James Anderson,18,2300,Office 365,2,From articles that I have read this policy is suppose to INSPIRE me to use there cloud based office 365 subscription service. It has failed to do this and instead all it has done is upset and alienate me to the point I will not buy or use either.,3
Ben Stokes,32,1020,Microsoft Access,3,"The main thing that I don't like about MS access is security because most time the file is not 100% protected especially if it has huge about of data. Also there's a data limit, so if you have more than 2 GB of data then you can't use MS access and this again due to security.",1
Jos Buttler,6,7000,Visual Studio Code,4,"Don't force me to struggle to figure out how to save a single damn document on my computer because it keeps defaulting to the 'cloud', which I can't access w/out internet which, gee, I usually don't have because I'm in the Bush.",3
Zappos,11,33100,Microsoft Virtual Server,1,Server-side Windows operating systems only for hosted systems.This makes the software incompatible for us.Please update the software or give as alternative solution for this issue.,3
Alex Hales,3,5100,Micrsoft Word,3,"Don't take money from me you didn't earn with innovation, and don't leave me with no option to buy your older products that I already know and love. This new version of word  sucks. It really and truly sucks",3
Ian Bell,12,4000,Microsoft PowerPoint,3,"There aren't as many import and export options as with other photo slideshow applications, which means it's not as easy to share my finished presentation.Please upgrade the software so that I can share them easily.",1
Steven Finn,22,3000,Microsoft Office 2013,2,"I installed this on my system on Thursday and removed it today (Saturday). The user interface made my eyes hurt and I'm not joking. ""The final straw, I run the Think-Cell graphing plug in with Powerpoint and Excel. It isn't supported yet on Office 2013.Finding no compelling reason to use 2013 instead of 2010 (which should have been my clue to stay away from it in the first place) I've removed it and put it back in the drawer",1
Eoin Morgan,9,3400,Microsoft Excel,3,"One of Excel's worst features is that is does not open multiple spreadsheets in a single window. Office Tab solves the problem by opening all Excel spreadsheets in a single instance of Excel with a row of tabs for each spreadsheet (I'm talking spreadsheets, not worksheets). You can even rename the spreadsheet by right-clicking its tab. Why doesn't Microsoft build this capability into its Office programs?",3
Allegion,20,24000,Microsoft SQL Server,3,"The introduction of In-Memory (sql 2014) has opened up new prospects but still has many limitations (data types, functions and various restrictions). Table partitioning is as useful as awkward to handle. The software still needs to be upgraded or else we should look for alternative software.",3
